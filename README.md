# RLUX: a language built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help me learn both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Language builing from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## On the backs of Giants

This project is my first foray into a _both_ a major practical project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and any sort of language building.

If you notice any major flaws please let me know.

## Versions

In the book I am basing this project on, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), there are 2 versions of the language that are specified and built, jlox and clox. They are built in [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) respectively. I wil be coverting the Java version of the language to Rust.

## Profesionalism

This project is in no means a professional project. I will not and do not work on it for a living. Please keep this in mind if you choose to contact me as I will not always be able to respond immediately, or at all. I thank you for any consideration you may have already taken in this regard.
