# RLUX: a language built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help me learn both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Language building from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## On the backs of Giants

This project is my first foray into a _both_ a major practical project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and any sort of language building.

If you notice any major flaws, please let me know.

## Versions

In the book I am basing this project on, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), two versions of the language are specified and built: jlox and clox. They are built in [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) respectively. I will be converting the Java version of the language to Rust.

## LLVM Migration
This project is undergoing an extremely major renovation to change from an interpreter to a compiler using LLVM

## Professionalism

This project is by no means professional. I will not and do not work on it for a living. Please keep this in mind if you choose to contact me, as I will not always be able to respond immediately or at all. Thank you for any consideration you may have already taken in this regard.
